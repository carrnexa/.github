# CarrNexa

**Modular Tools for Curious Minds.**

CarrNexa is a systems engineering studio focused on **pragmatic software craftsmanship**. We reject modern bloat in favor of architectural clarity, type safety, and raw performance.

## Operating Principles

1. **Density > Abstraction**: We prefer raw HTML/CSS/JS over heavy frameworks. We treat code as a liability, not an asset.
2. **Glass Box Engineering**: Our public code is transparent; our secrets are dark. We build in the open to foster trust and enforce security through transparency, not obscurity.
3. **Systems Thinking**: Every project, from a shell script to a distributed backend, is treated as a component of a larger machine.

## The Technology Stack

We build high-throughput systems using strict, performant tooling.

- **Core**: Python 3.12+ (Async), Rust, TypeScript (Strict).
- **Infrastructure**: Arch Linux, Docker, Unix Domain Sockets.
- **Frontend**: Vite (MPA), Vanilla JS, CSS Variables.

## Public Repositories
