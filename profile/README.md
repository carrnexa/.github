# CarrNexa

Modular tools for curious minds. Built with clarity, shared with purpose.

## About Us

CarrNexa is a small studio that builds high-performance software, for everything from one-off scripts and tools to full-fledged applications. Guided by pragmatic engineering and a deep respect for craftsmanship, we publish what we use, share what can help others, and enjoy pushing technical boundaries.

With an emphasis on quality and maintainability, the projects we create are designed to be reliable, performant, and adaptable. To us, software is a craft; and every line of code provides an opportunity to learn, refine, and create something meaningful together.
